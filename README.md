# prework-study-guide

## Description

- I want to be able to reference important information from my prework portion of my coding bootcamp.
- I built this project to provide a reference to my prework portion but also to test my new coding skills.
- This gives me and other students a rough outline of the topics in prework as well as a guide on what to study first
- I learned to use github, use gitflow with the command line terminal, and code in a few programming languages useful for full stack web development. Those languages are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Markdown.
